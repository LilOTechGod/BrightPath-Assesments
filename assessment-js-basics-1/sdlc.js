// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// #1 Planning
// #2 Analysis of Requirements
// #3 Design
// #4 Implementation
// #5 Testing & Integration
// #6 Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." ;
const analysisOfRequirements = 'The second step is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team.';
const design = 'the design phase will include the development of a prototype model. Creating a pre-production version of the product can give the team the opportunity to visualize what the product will look like and make changes without having to go through the hassle of rewriting code.';
const implementation = 'The actual development phase is where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product.';
const testingAndIntegration = 'Before getting the software product out the door to the production environment, its important to have your quality assurance team perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and does what its meant to do.During the integration phase, your final product is delivered to your intended user.'
const maintain = 'The maintenance phase is the final stage of the SDLC, In the maintenance stage, users may find bugs and errors that were missed in the earlier testing phase. These bugs need to be fixed for better user experience and retention. In some cases, these can lead to going back to the first step of the SDLC. '
