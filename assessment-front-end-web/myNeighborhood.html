		<h1>My Neighborhood</h1>

		<p>
			My neighborhood is very beautiful if I do say so myself, not just because I live in it! Homes here have a modern look and what I like most about my peaceful neighborhood is, people here care about their community and are interested in keeping it crime-free. Its a place where neighbors know each other and are open to socializing
